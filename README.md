DevOps – Beginner Overview

This repository covers the basic theoretical understanding of DevOps to help beginners move confidently into hands-on practice.

What is DevOps

DevOps is a way of working where development and operations teams work together to build, test, deploy, and monitor applications faster and more reliably. It focuses on collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.

DevOps Lifecycle

DevOps follows a continuous loop:
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor
This loop ensures faster delivery and constant feedback.

CI & CD

Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically combines and tests code whenever developers push changes.

Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): Automatically prepares or deploys tested code to servers.

Containerization

Containers: Pack applications with all dependencies so they run the same everywhere.

Docker: Creates and runs containers.

Kubernetes: Manages, scales, and keeps multiple containers running.

Configuration Management & IaC

Terraform: Creates cloud infrastructure using code.

Ansible: Configures and manages servers automatically.

Monitoring & Logging

Prometheus: Collects system and application health metrics.

Grafana: Displays metrics using dashboards.

ELK Stack: Collects, stores, and visualizes application logs.

Cloud Platforms

AWS & Azure: Cloud platforms that provide rented servers, storage, databases, and networking.

EC2 / Virtual Machines: Cloud servers where applications run.
